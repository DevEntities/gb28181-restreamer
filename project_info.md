We are seeking a skilled developer to create a lightweight software solution that can restream a local RTSP stream using the GB28181 protocol. The software should also have the capability to scan a specified directory and its sub-directories for video files (.mp4 and .avi) and stream them via the GB28181 protocol.

Key Requirements:

1. RTSP Stream Restreaming:
   Implement functionality to restream a local RTSP stream using the GB28181 protocol.

2. Video File Scanning:
   The software should scan a designated directory and its sub-directories for .mp4 and .avi video files.
   Enable streaming of these video files using the GB28181 protocol.

3. Configuration File:
   The software must accept a configuration file that includes:
   SIP server IP
   SIP server port
   SIP server ID
   GB28181 device ID
   Path to the directory containing videos
   Other necessary arguments

4. GB28181 requirements
   The GB28181 component will be responsible for initiating SIP registrations and handling INVITE requests.
