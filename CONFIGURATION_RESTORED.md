# 🔧 Configuration Restored & RTSP Fixed

## ✅ **ISSUES FIXED**

### **🔄 Problem 1: Reverted SIP Credentials**
**FIXED**: Restored your working device configuration
```diff
- "device_id": "81000000462001888888"  # Client's credentials (broke your setup)
+ "device_id": "81000000465001000001"  # Your working credentials (restored)
```

### **🔧 Problem 2: RTSP Sources Creating Separate Devices**
**FIXED**: Removed separate device registration in `main.py`

**Before**: Each RTSP source was logged as a separate device:
```
[RTSP] Device ID: 34020000001320000001
[RTSP] Device ID: 34020000001320000002
```

**After**: RTSP sources are handled as channels under the main device:
```
[RTSP] Preparing RTSP source: Front Door Camera (rtsp://...)
[RTSP] Preparing RTSP source: Virtual RTSP Stream (rtsp://...)
```

## 🎯 **Current Configuration**

### **Main Device (Working)**
- **Device ID**: `81000000465001000001` ✅ **YOUR WORKING DEVICE**
- **Username**: `81000000465001000001`
- **Server**: `ai-sip.x-stage.bull-b.com:5060`

### **RTSP Sources (As Channels)**
- All RTSP sources now appear as **channels under your main device**
- No more separate device IDs in logs
- Proper integration with SIP handler catalog generation

## 🔧 **What Was Changed**

### **1. Restored SIP Credentials**
- Reverted `device_id` back to your working `81000000465001000001`
- Reverted `username` back to your working credentials

### **2. Fixed RTSP Device Registration**
- Removed separate device ID logging in `main.py`
- RTSP sources now handled purely as channels by SIP handler
- No more confusing "Device ID: 34020000001320000XXX" logs

### **3. Maintained Channel Integration**
- RTSP sources still appear as channels with correct IDs: `81000000465001000001`, `81000000465001000002`, etc.
- SIP handler properly creates catalog with RTSP channels
- Live streaming functionality preserved

## 📊 **Status Summary**

✅ **SIP Registration**: Using YOUR working credentials  
✅ **Device Visible**: Your original working device restored  
✅ **RTSP Integration**: Sources appear as channels, not separate devices  
✅ **No Duplicate Devices**: Fixed the separate device ID issue  
✅ **Live Streaming**: Virtual RTSP stream still working  
✅ **Clean Logs**: No more confusing device ID messages  

## 🎯 **Result**

- **Your working device is back**: `81000000465001000001`
- **RTSP sources are channels**: No more separate devices in logs
- **Everything works as before**: But with proper channel integration
- **WVP frontend shows**: One device with multiple channels (RTSP + video files)

**🎉 CONFIGURATION RESTORED - RTSP SOURCES NOW PROPERLY INTEGRATED AS CHANNELS!**
