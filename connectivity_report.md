# GB28181 WVP-pro Connectivity Report

## Summary

We've attempted to register a device with the WVP-pro platform but have encountered connectivity issues. Our investigation indicates there may be firewall rules or network configurations preventing successful SIP communication.

## Details

### Network Connectivity Tests

1. **Ping Test**:
   - The server at `ai-sip.x-stage.bull-b.com` (203.142.93.131) does not respond to ICMP ping
   - Result: 100% packet loss

2. **TCP Port Scan**:
   - Port 5060/tcp shows as "filtered" which typically indicates a firewall is blocking access
   - Command: `nmap -Pn -p 5060 ai-sip.x-stage.bull-b.com`

3. **UDP Port Scan**:
   - Port 5060/udp shows as "open|filtered" which means we can't determine if it's actually accessible
   - Command: `sudo nmap -Pn -sU -p 5060 ai-sip.x-stage.bull-b.com`

### SIP Registration Attempts

1. **Outgoing SIP REGISTER Packets**:
   - Our server successfully sends SIP REGISTER packets to 203.142.93.131:5060
   - Multiple retries were observed in the logs
   - No response packets were received from the SIP server

2. **tcpdump Capture**:
   ```
   01:58:18.563264 ens5  Out IP 172.31.7.94.5080 > 203.142.93.131.5060: SIP: REGISTER sip:ai-sip.x-stage.bull-b.com:5060 SIP/2.0
   01:58:22.563075 ens5  Out IP 172.31.7.94.5080 > 203.142.93.131.5060: SIP: REGISTER sip:ai-sip.x-stage.bull-b.com:5060 SIP/2.0
   01:59:15.603562 ens5  Out IP 172.31.7.94.5080 > 203.142.93.131.5060: SIP: REGISTER sip:ai-sip.x-stage.bull-b.com:5060 SIP/2.0
   01:59:16.103447 ens5  Out IP 172.31.7.94.5080 > 203.142.93.131.5060: SIP: REGISTER sip:ai-sip.x-stage.bull-b.com:5060 SIP/2.0
   01:59:17.103528 ens5  Out IP 172.31.7.94.5080 > 203.142.93.131.5060: SIP: REGISTER sip:ai-sip.x-stage.bull-b.com:5060 SIP/2.0
   01:59:19.103726 ens5  Out IP 172.31.7.94.5080 > 203.142.93.131.5060: SIP: REGISTER sip:ai-sip.x-stage.bull-b.com:5060 SIP/2.0
   ```

## Recommended Actions

1. **Network Firewall Check**:
   - Confirm with the network team that our server IP (172.31.7.94) is allowed to access the SIP server
   - Request firewall rules to allow UDP traffic to/from port 5060

2. **Server Configuration Verification**:
   - Confirm the SIP server address and port are correct
   - Verify the device ID format and credentials are acceptable
   - Check if the server requires specific SIP headers or configurations

3. **Alternative Connectivity Options**:
   - Consider testing from a different network location
   - Ask if the WVP platform has a test environment or alternative access methods
   - Determine if any VPN or other secure connection method is required

## Next Steps

Based on the failed connectivity tests, we need additional information from the client before we can proceed with implementing the GB28181 integration. The core issue appears to be network connectivity rather than our implementation.
