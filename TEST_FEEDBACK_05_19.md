# Other Feedback

## appsink/appsrc input mode
- How to switch to this mode?
- test_appsink_appsrc.py doesn't seem like it tests this feature?

## WVP-pro device registration
In the documents, you mentioned that I should manually add the device to the device list in WVP. This isn't correct because it should automatically add the device to the device list when registering to the SIP. Please make sure this works.

## Video catalog / Time series query
In the documents, you mentioned that the videos will be listed in the device's channels. We actually want it to be listed in the device's recording list. 

The page can be found in WVP. ÂõΩÊ†áËÆæÂ§á(Device List) -> ÈÄöÈÅì(Channels) -> Êõ¥Â§ö(More) -> ËÆæÂ§áÂΩïÂÉè(Device Recordings)

This utilises the Time Series Query feature.
