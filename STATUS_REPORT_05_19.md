# GB28181 Restreamer Status Report
Date: 2025-05-19

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Appsink/Appsrc Mode
- ✅ Basic frame processing functionality is working
- ✅ Frame processor wrapper correctly handles timestamp and stream_info
- ✅ Test script successfully runs and processes frames
- ⚠️ Pipeline state change warnings need investigation

### 2. RTSP Pipeline
- ✅ Added videoconvert element to resolve "not-linked" errors
- ✅ Improved pipeline configuration with proper format negotiation
- ✅ Added buffer handling and queue elements
- ⚠️ Still seeing pipeline state change warnings

### 3. Dependencies
- ✅ Added pjsip-tools to installation script
- ✅ Added rtsp-simple-server ARM build process
- ✅ Added missing dependencies:
  - gstreamer1.0-rtsp
  - ffmpeg
  - screen

## Pending Issues

### 1. RTSP Simple Server
- ❌ ARM architecture support needs verification
- ❌ Server exits with code 1 in test_integrated_app.py
- Action: Need to verify ARM build process and test server stability

### 2. Pipeline State Changes
- ⚠️ Warnings about pipeline state changes in test_appsink_appsrc.py
- Action: Need to investigate and optimize pipeline state transitions

### 3. WVP-pro Integration
- ✅ Automatic device registration is implemented
- ✅ Device appears in WVP-pro device list automatically
- ✅ Time series query feature is working
- ✅ Recordings appear in device's recording list

## Next Steps

1. **Pipeline Optimization**
   - Investigate pipeline state change warnings
   - Add more robust error handling
   - Consider adding pipeline state monitoring

2. **RTSP Server**
   - Verify ARM build process
   - Add more detailed logging for server startup
   - Implement better error handling for server failures

3. **Testing**
   - Add more comprehensive tests for frame processing
   - Add stress tests for long-running streams
   - Add network condition simulation tests

## Configuration Updates

The following configuration parameters have been updated:
```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "format": "RGB",
    "width": 640,
    "height": 480,
    "framerate": 30,
    "buffer_size": 33554432,
    "queue_size": 3000,
    "sync": false,
    "async": false
  }
}
```

## Known Limitations

1. Pipeline state changes may occur during stream startup/shutdown
2. RTSP server may need manual intervention on ARM systems
3. Frame processing may introduce latency in some cases

## Recommendations

1. Monitor pipeline state changes in production
2. Consider implementing automatic recovery for pipeline state issues
3. Add more detailed logging for troubleshooting
4. Consider adding performance metrics for frame processing
