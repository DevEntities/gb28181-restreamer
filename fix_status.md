# GB28181 Restreamer Fix Status
Date: 2025-05-19

## Testing Results

### 1. RTSP Stream Test
‚úÖ Fixed
- RTSP pipeline updated: added queue elements, improved format negotiation, and buffer handling.
- Pipeline now transitions through all states and completes cleanly.

### 2. Appsink/Appsrc Test
‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Working
- ‚úÖ Basic functionality works
- ‚úÖ Frame processing successful
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Pipeline state change warnings (now with detailed logging)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Format negotiation issues (improved, but monitor in future tests)

### 3. Dependencies Installation
‚úÖ Fixed
- Architecture detection now uses Python for reliability.
- Install script builds correct binaries for both x86_64 and ARM.
- PJSIP built from source.

### 4. WVP-pro Integration & Time-Series Query
üîÑ In Progress - May 20
- Device registration implementation updated
- Enhanced SIP configuration for WVP-pro compatibility
- Improved registration process logging and error handling
- Added TCP transport support and configuration options
- Created standalone test script for registration verification
- Next: Test device registration and verify in WVP-pro platform

## Critical Issues

1. **RTSP Pipeline**
   - [x] Fix h264parse to videoconvert linking
   - [x] Add proper queue elements
   - [x] Implement format negotiation

2. **Dependencies**
   - [x] Add PJSIP build from source
   - [x] Update installation script
   - [x] Verify ARM build process

3. **Pipeline State Changes**
   - [x] Add state monitoring
   - [x] Implement recovery mechanism
   - [x] Add detailed logging

4. **WVP-pro Integration**
   - [x] Update device registration configuration
   - [x] Improve SIP message sender for WVP-pro
   - [x] Create test script for registration verification
   - [ ] Verify device registration in WVP-pro
   - [ ] Test time-series query (recordings list)
   - [ ] Document results

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **WVP-pro Integration Testing** (May 20)
   - [x] Run test_registration.sh script to verify device registration
   - [ ] Log in to WVP-pro frontend to confirm device presence
   - [ ] Check device status and channels
   - [ ] Test streaming capability
   - [ ] Document test results

2. **Time-Series Query** (May 20-21)
   - [ ] Study WVP-pro API for time-series query implementation
   - [ ] Implement time-series query response in the RecordInfo handler
   - [ ] Test with WVP-pro platform
   - [ ] Verify recording list appears in WVP-pro interface

## Next Steps

1. **Today** (May 20)
   - [x] Update SIP registration configuration
   - [x] Improve SIP message sender for WVP-pro
   - [x] Create test script for registration verification
   - [ ] Test device registration with WVP-pro
   - [ ] Begin time-series query implementation

2. **Tomorrow** (May 21)
   - [ ] Complete time-series query testing
   - [ ] Debug any issues found
   - [ ] Finalize documentation

3. **This Week** (May 22-23)
   - [ ] Complete all WVP-pro integration tests
   - [ ] Add performance monitoring
   - [ ] Document all fixes and improvements

## Notes
1. Pipeline state changes are now logged in detail
2. Dependencies installation is robust and cross-architecture
3. Format negotiation and error handling improved
4. WVP-pro integration updates implemented - testing in progress
5. Added test_device_registration.py and test_registration.sh scripts
